# QuestLike

QuestLike is a short prototype developed by [Liam Harrison](https://liamharrison.io).

The graphics are built with [SadConsole](https://sadconsole.com/) which is itself built on [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/).

## What is QuestLike?
QuestLike is a prototype inspired by Dwarf Fortress & Zork. You're presented with a console like screen and can move your character around a room filled with items and creatures.

You can type complex commands or click your way through the screens with intetactive buttons and links to do anything.

The game also has a complex biological simulation complete with bodyparts, bones, muscles, blood vessels, nerves, major organs and even cybernetics! Major organs preform critical functions entities require to operate, because each bodypart uses some amount of oxygen its important to have lungs large enough to process all the deoxygenated blood the body might generate. The humanoid body alone simulates nearly a hundred different organs, bones, muscles and various extremities. Every bodypart, vessel and nerve can be severed, reattatched & reconfigured at the players will.

**In brief these are the features already implemented:**
- Body simulation.
- Physicalized objects & interactions.
  - Grabbing items.
  - Equiping items.
  - Inventories.
  - Using items.
- NPCs.
- Walls & impassable objects.
- Turn based movement & combat.
- Spell system.
- Pathfinding.
- Adjustable screen width & height.
- Saving & loading.


**Planned & in development features:**
- Interactable paths to other rooms.
- Dialogue system.
- Implement friendly & enemy NPC AI.
- Add a surgery system that allows the player to operate or operate on with the existing bodypart system.

## How can I develop my own version of QuestLike?
You can fork this repo and download the source files to your computer. You'll need a copy of Visual Studio to open the project and when you do you will get a prompt to download all the packages that you will need to compile and run the source code.
